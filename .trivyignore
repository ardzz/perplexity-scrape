# Trivy Ignore File
# Documentation: https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/configuration/filtering/
#
# This file allows you to suppress specific CVE findings that have been
# reviewed and determined to be false positives or accepted risks.
#
# =============================================================================
# FORMAT
# =============================================================================
# Each line should contain a CVE ID to ignore. Comments start with #.
#
# Example:
# CVE-2023-12345  # Accepted risk: Not exploitable in our context because...
# CVE-2024-67890  # False positive: Package is not used in production
#
# =============================================================================
# GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================
# 1. ALWAYS document WHY a CVE is being suppressed
# 2. Review suppressions periodically (quarterly recommended)
# 3. Only suppress after security team review
# 4. Prefer upgrading dependencies over suppressing CVEs
#
# =============================================================================
# SUPPRESSED VULNERABILITIES
